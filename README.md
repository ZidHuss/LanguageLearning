# LanguageLearning

## What is it?
This is a program written in Java, it was originally written for a Software Architectures Assignment to make an educational Game. The game allows teachers to write and built up an interactive story, and then for their students to read, learn the words and begin to read. Design originally for teaching French to young children, it can be used for any interactive story.

## How does it work
A teacher can write the story by editing the CSV files inside the data folder. They can customise the backgrounds, the characters and the dialogue.

## Dialogue Syntax
`[original phrase](translated phrase)` - Show a mouseover with the translated phrase over the original phrase
`<animation:identifier>` - Show an animation when this diagloue is loaded possible animations: fadein, fadeout, invisible, visible, chat (not avaliable for items), wiggle. Possible indentifiers: right, left, middle.
